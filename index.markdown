## <j>Welcome</j>
Welcome to the website of our ADA project. [Here][git_link] you can find the Github repository to find all the calculations that led to the plots used during the analysis.

## <j>Choice of datasets and question</j> 
Among all the proposed datasets, we choose to retain the [CMU movie summary corpus][CMU]. This dataset gathers informations such as the movie title, its genre, the release date, the langage, the casting, but also a summary of the preprocessed with the Standford CoreNLP pipeline. With all these informations available, we chose to study the **representation of stereotypes in cinema**.
